# Getting Started with Anaconda 

Anaconda is a Python distribution by Continuum org. It comes with large set of Python librabries and sophisticated package management tool conda.

Conda package manager is better than Python's native package management tool Pip as conda resolves non-python dependencies as well.

There is a smaller version of anaconda available called miniconda. It comes with relatively less number of preinstalled libraries. Anaconda also have other tools like Jupyter Notebook.

## What is Beautiful Soup ?

Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating,
searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and
extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write an application.

Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing
documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless the document
doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. 

Then you just have to specify the original encoding.

Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib,
allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
flexibility. 

We need to install few libraries to run the code 
### Installing the required third-party libraries ->

1). Open Anaconda Prompt first ! 
Then to install external libraries in python is to use pip. pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
All you need to type in Anaconda Prompt:

pip install requests

pip install html5lib

pip install bs4
