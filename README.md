This is the python script to  download file consisting of Must Do Coding Problems from GeeksforGeeks platform using Beautiful Soup 4 in python

Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating,
searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and
extracting what you need. It doesn't take much code to write an application.

Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing
documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, unless the document
doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. 

Then you just have to specify the original encoding.

Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib,
allowing you to try out different parsing strategies or trade speed for
flexibility. 

Installing the required third-party libraries ->

Easiest way to install external libraries in python is to use pip. pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
All you need to do is:
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
pip install bs4
